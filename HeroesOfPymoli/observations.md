##HeroesOfPymoli Observations

#Observation 1: Player Demographics
The demographics of this data are mainly male users, making up 84.03% of the players. While the ages vary from <10 to over 40 years old the greatest concentration of users is between 15 and 29 (cumulatively making up 76.74% of the players) with 20-24 year olds specifically accounting for just under half (44.79%) of total players.

#Observation 2: Purchasing by Demographic Grouping
Unsurpisingly, males brought in a vast majority of overall sales.  One thing to note is that both Other / Non-Disclosed and Female groups had higher average purchase price per person with $3.35 and $3.20 compared to $3.02 for males.  Similarly in the age categories the age grouping of 20-24 had the highest total purchase value but the groups of 35-39 and <10 had significantly higher average purchase price per transaction with $3.60 and $3.35 respectively with 20-24 years olds amounting to just $3.05 per purchase.

#Observation 3: Item Purchasing
"Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" was the most purchased item with 12 purchases generating $50.76 of sales.  One item that stands out in the item sales data is "Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy".  Though the number of sales is high at 8 it only generated $8.16 on those sales making it the only item in the top ten purchased items with a sales amount of less than $19.  This is due to it's relatively low item price of $1.02 with most of the others being above $3.
