# PyCitySchools Observations

## Observation 1: Overall 
For the majority of the districts and in the average groupings, students were passing reading at a higher rate than math.  The overall passing rate averaged out to be roughly 80% with the highest performing schools having rates around 95% and the lowest being around 73%.

## Observation 2: Passing Rates Compared
Interstingly, in the low performing schools the passing rates between math and reading had a much greater disparity than in the high performing schools.  The top 5 performing schools have relatively close passing rates for math and reading differing by only a few percentage points.  Alternatively, the passing rate for math in the 5 worst performing schools is roughly 15 percentage points less for math than reading.

## Observation 3: Passing Rates Grouped
Oddly enough, schools that spend less per student end up with higher passing rates.  While there may be counfounding variables to this the data shows this trend.  In addition, schools with less students have higher passing rates.  Finally, charter schools have much higher passing rates in both reading and math.  The desparity in math passing rates is much larger at roughly 29% whereas reading is only roughly 16% less in district schools than in charter schools.
